# Text-to-MIDI Project Rules (Legacy Reference)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This file has been superseded by a comprehensive rule system.
> **Please use the new rule system at: [`rules/RULE-INDEX.md`](rules/RULE-INDEX.md)**

## Quick Migration Guide

### For AI Assistants
- **New Primary Rules:** [`rules/ai-rules/assistant-guidelines.md`](rules/ai-rules/assistant-guidelines.md)
- **Architecture Rules:** [`rules/architecture/module-structure.md`](rules/architecture/module-structure.md)

### For Developers
- **Project Structure:** [`rules/architecture/module-structure.md`](rules/architecture/module-structure.md)
- **Coding Standards:** [`rules/development/coding-standards.md`](rules/development/coding-standards.md)
- **Algorithm Rules:** [`rules/algorithms/text-to-midi-algorithms.md`](rules/algorithms/text-to-midi-algorithms.md)

### For Designers
- **UI/UX Standards:** [`rules/ui-ux/design-standards.md`](rules/ui-ux/design-standards.md)

## Legacy Content (Superseded)

### Core Technologies (MOVED)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) - NO UI frameworks
- **Audio Library:** Tone.js (latest stable version) - MANDATORY for all audio operations
- **Development Server:** http-server (v14.1.1) for local development
- **Build Tool:** None required - pure static files

### Forbidden Technologies (MOVED)
- **UI Frameworks:** React, Vue, Angular, or any other UI framework
- **Build Tools:** Webpack, Vite, Parcel (keep it simple)
- **Backend:** No server-side processing allowed
- **Other Audio Libraries:** Web Audio API direct usage (use Tone.js wrapper)
